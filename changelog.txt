    - Efficiency upgrade will increase the efficiency of your solar panels and make them produce more RF/tick.
    - Low light upgrade will allow you solar panels to generate energy in low light environment (at night) but will be less efficient when the sun is too bright.
    - Machine traversal upgrade will allow your solar panels to send energy to connected machines without the need for cables. As long as the machines are touching each other they will receive energy. 10 pulverizers in a straight line? No problem!
    - Transfer rate upgrade increases the amount of RF that the solar panel can transfer per tick.
    - Capacity upgrade increases the size of the solar panel's internal storage.
- When dismantling a solar panel with a wrench. It will keep its installed upgrade in addition to its stored energy.
- Config: Tons of new configuration.
 - Each upgrade can be disabled in the config (it will not appear in game).
 - The effect of each upgrade can be tweaked in the config.
 - The production/transfer rate and capacity of each tier of solar panel can be tweaked in the config.
